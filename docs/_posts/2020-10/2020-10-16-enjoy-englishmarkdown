Today I drank with a work colleague to celebrate 1 year project success.
 
In that chat, he has interested in travelling abroad. And want to improve his English. But recently don't do that.

For me, want to do that too. Before I used English at work to communicate with people in Singapore. At that time, I had improved English everyday. Using Online English Lesson(RareJob).

But Recently dont't do that neither.

In this weekend. I'm taking a English lesson after a long time.
