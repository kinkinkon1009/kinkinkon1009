After a long time, I took a Rarejob lesson and communicated with people in English. My English is not getting rusty so much. So I somehow managed to understand what the teacher said. and I could express what I wanted to say.

I hope that someday I would use English at work fluently or live abroad maybe...www For that reason, I continue to blush my English skill. What kind of near goal make me more motivated to keep doing?
