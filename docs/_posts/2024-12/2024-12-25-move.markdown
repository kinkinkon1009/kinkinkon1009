I moved with my wife. 

We packed up on Saturday and moved with a moving company on Wednesday. I think it took two moving trucks. A lot of trash was left behind, so there's a lot of cleaning will be needed later. 

The new rental house feels a bit more spacious. It's like a bonus year for about a year.
