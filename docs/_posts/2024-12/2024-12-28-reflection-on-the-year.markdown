    - I have some issues flagged in my health checkup. I will work on improving them through my diet and other adjustments.
  - Connections
    - I was able to meet with some aquaitances from the past, especially those who have started their own business, and it was very interesting.
  - SNS
    - Youtube, Netflix, Slack etc are time-cosuming. I must find a way to manage them effectively.

## 2025 Resolution
- Work
  - Team
    - Build a better team structure and improve the cycle step by step
      - define role responsibilities, checkpoint meetings, leaders, communication flow, and the PDCA cycle.
  - Technology
    - Technical improvement themes for each quarter
      - mainly E2E automated testing and system design for client side
- Private
  - English Level C1 from B2
    - one hour every day. 30 minutes lesson and 30 minutes vocabulary session
  - Trip
    - Do activitiy alone locally, even without my wife.
- An ambitious goal that might seem hard to imagine from the perspective of building connections and managing time effectively
  - Gradually extend the time spent abroad each year. Move abroad starting at the age of 40.
    - This would continuously motivate me and serve as a guding principle for new actions
