A 3-day, 2-night trip to Karuizawa.

Two consecutive days of fusion course meals blending Japanese and Spanish cuisine. Since the menu was the same, the hotel arranged something different for us.

I planned to ski alone for a few hours, but I gave up when I realized it would cost nearly 20,000 yen for clothing and a lift ticket.

At a soba restaurant in Nakakaruizawa, we could only buy one soba to share as they only accepted cash. On the way back, the train didnâ€™t accept electronic payment either, so we walked for about an hour to return to the hotel.
