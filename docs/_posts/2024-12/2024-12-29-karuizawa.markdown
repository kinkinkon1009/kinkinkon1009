A 3-day, 2-night trip to Karuizawa.

The hotel meals were delicious. Two consecutive days of fusion course meals blending Japanese and Spanish cuisine. Since the menu was the same, the hotel arranged something different for us on the second day.

The soba for lunch we ate under the cold sky was incredibly delicious, and the mountain vegetable tempura was absolutely amazing. We could only buy one soba to share as they only accepted cash.

I planned to ski alone for a few hours, but I gave up when I realized it would cost nearly 20,000 yen for clothing and a lift ticket.

On the way back, the train didnâ€™t accept electronic payment either, so we walked for about an hour to return to the hotel.
